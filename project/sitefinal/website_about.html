				Colors play an important role in my works, as it is used to bring the piece to life. As a contemporary art student, my goal is to learn the relationship between colors. How they interact with one another through the contrast and complements they make. And as I continue to create these color compositions I soon realize the intent of color isn't to add life to a piece but to create harmony and unison as colors slowly dance with one another. However, the transition between colors can be harsh as not all shades or tints are compatible. Because of this, I am aesthetically drawn towards the usage of muted tones to bridge colors together through the contrast in saturation and values. My process involves a muted base color and dark values. As the piece advances, it slowly evolves into a more coherent work with saturated colors that highlight certain details. Additionally, slight shifts in tint and values are added to create subtle transitions, creating a sense of realism while maintaining the semi-realistic style. The meaning behind my works is of conceptual intent, imaginary worlds in which fantasy exists. The landscapes put the audience in a different world in which it invokes a sense of adventure grandiose on an epic scale. The portraits, however, bring the audience closer on a personal level where subtlety tells taller tales than obvious representations.
