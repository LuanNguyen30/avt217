				<h2>Digital Art 54 x 32 inches</h2>
				<p>The picture "Desert" was made during a time of stress for me. It was the later half of the semester, school and work were both getting to me and it seemed like I had a tough road ahead of me. The mountains and the sun setting were a representation of how I had a rough path ahead but at least it was almost over.</p>
