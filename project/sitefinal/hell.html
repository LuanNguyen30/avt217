				<h1>Hell's Gate</h1>
				<h2>Digital Art 54 x 32 inches</h2>
				<p>The picture "Hell" was made during senior year of high school. It was the end of an era for me and the future was unknown for me. I was scared of what I was going to do after high school. College crept up so fast and I wasn't sure if I was ready for it yet. This piece is a representation of the dreariness I felt, as if a monster suddenly came out of the shadows, blindsiding me.</p>
